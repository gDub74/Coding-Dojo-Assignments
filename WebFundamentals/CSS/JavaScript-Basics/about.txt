This assignment for Coding Dojo CSS section of the Web Fundamentals course was super fun! I learned alot about positining block and inline and inline-block elements. Also I feel like I've began to grasp the parent/child relationship when setting a rule in CSS for nested elements - for example a <li> nested in a <div id="#">. -In CSS I would call that with # li....The funny thing about this assignment to me is that there is actually no JavaScript code written here- this about learning the interaction of HTML and CSS. But writting out all the text manually about JavaScript was fun and is helping me learn more of the terms and properties of JS. I'm super excited to dig into JS and the other programing languages I will be learning and I feel like I am building a great solid foundation with the way they will interact with the languages of the web!
