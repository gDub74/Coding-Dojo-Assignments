            <h3>JavaScript Basics</h3>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross platform, object oriented scripiting language. JavaScript is very popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small anf lightweight language allowing maxium flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or node server), it can be connected to the objects of those environments to provide programatic control over them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><a class="links" href="#">Variable Decleration</a> Javascript variables are containers for storing data values-imagine you had a cup filled with coffee, the cup holds coffee, the variable holds a value. All JavaScript variabls must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span>var x;</span></p></li>
                <li><p><a class="links" href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign vslues to JavaScript variables-our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment opperator assigns a value to a variable. <span>var x = 10;</span></p></li>
                <li><p><a class="links" href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; To be able to opperate on a variable you need to know the data type. There are 6 data types that are JavaScrtpt primitives: Boolean-<span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> null <span>-null</span> naka nothing;Number <span>-42</span>  or <span>3.14159;</span> String <span>-"Coding Dojo rocks!;</span>Array- <span>[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object- <span>{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span></p></li>
                <li><p><a class="links" href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write with code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions-hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have ben met. You can use conditional statments in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statments: <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, <span>if</span> the first condition is false; <span>else</span> we execute this block of code;</p></li>
                <li><p><a class="links" href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programing language, but they all essentually do the same thing: They will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</p></li>
                <li><p><a class="links" href="#">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulationn of a code block. When we call a function we run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example, imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea. We open the manual to get started,first we screw the legs to the table top, next we place the table the right way up. Done! Sadly there are a lot more tables to do so lets call our functions over and over and over again.</p></li>
