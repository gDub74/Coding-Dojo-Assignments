In this project I continued learning about how to set up the framing of the block elements of the page. With a div wrapper around the whole page I learned that the nested   will conform to the set width of the wrapper. I also learned a lot about styling and organizing the style sheet so that it is easy to read and follows the flow of the page and when possible I learned  how to style multiple elements at the same time by separating the attribute names with a comma. I really enjoyed being able to look at the image of the project that we were to recreate and now understand the organizational markup of the page in a visual sense. The hardest thing to figure out were some inline images in between some link tags. After much experimintation I finally figured to use a negative margin to get the images to sit down lower and place them exactly where I wanted them to be. I look forward to the next challenge!
